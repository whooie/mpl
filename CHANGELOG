### Removed

## [0.1.1] - 2024-10-21

### Changed

- Replaced incorrect references in README code examples to `mpl` as a crate
  name; the name is actually `matplotlib`.
- Instead of dumbly recording all prelude and non-prelude commands in the same
  vector in `Mpl`, separate them out so that the command list doesn't have to be
  re-sorted all the time.

## [0.1.0] - 2024-08-01

### Added

- First working release
